Export Settings
- exclude with: dlcs/*
- export console wrapper: debug and release

- export with excludes
- export pck/zip
	- zip to easily check content

- bat file: FOLDERS MUST EXIST!

- careful: using excluded resource--> game crash at start (see console)

- careful: new files are NOT auto-added in the exluded in the export options!
	- work around: cfg manager
		careful: after writing the cfg, project > export only updates after reloading the project!

- @onready var my_texture = Works in Editor, but FAILS in Build

- Demo: Start Build, Show BG, Delete more and more DLCs, Show that BG changes
- GitHub
- Show Folder Structure (Windows/Godot)
- Export Settings (build, dlcs, exludes, console wrapper)
	- New files NOT auto-added
- Explain different: Editor vs Build
	- Sprite <- Corgi (works in Editor bc resource is always there, Build does not when dlc folder is exluded)
		- Fixed by loading dlc in _init() and not in _ready() in DlcManager 
			- EXCEPT IS DLC FILE IS DELETED!
- Make_Builds.bat

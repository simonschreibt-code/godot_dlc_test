- Demo: Start Build, Show BG, Delete more and more DLCs, Show that BG changes

- GitHub
	- Make_Builds.bat

- Show Folder Structure (Windows/Godot)

- Export Settings
	- build (exclude: dlcs/*)
	- dlcs
		- careful: new files are NOT auto-added in the exluded in the export options!
		- CFG manager
			- careful: after writing the cfg, project > export only updates after reloading the project!
	- console wrapper
	- New files NOT auto-added
	- zip to easily check content

- Explain different: Editor vs Build
	- Sprite <- Corgi (works in Editor bc resource is always there, Build does not when dlc folder is exluded)
		- Fixed by loading dlc in >>> _init() <<< and not in _ready() in DlcManager 
		- EXCEPT IS DLC FILE IS DELETED! --> CRASH

- Show different usecases in game.gd
